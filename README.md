This is the Uppsala University Bachelors project built by a group consisting of Elisabeth Ryan, Filip Nystrand, Norah Nav√©r & Tijana Barac.
It is a front-end built with React and a little help from Bootstrap. The front end connects to a database created as a bachelors project from a previous year and is populated by the stakeholder in the project.
